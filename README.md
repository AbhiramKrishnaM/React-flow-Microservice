# Project Name

## Overview

This project is designed to function as a microservice that integrates with a Vue.js application. It will process data provided by the Vue app and generate dashboards based on the outputs of various nodes. The dashboards will be rendered within the Vue project, accessible via a navigation bar.

## Features

- Integration with Vue.js for seamless dashboard rendering.
- API calls to trigger backend jobs and generate visualizations.
- Microservice architecture for modular and scalable design.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   BACKEND_URL=http://your-backend-url
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Build for Production**

   To build the project for production, use:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Usage

- **Integrate with Vue.js**: Import the microservice into your Vue project and use it to render dashboards.
- **API Endpoints**: Use the provided API endpoints to trigger backend jobs and fetch visualization data.
- **Dashboard Rendering**: Access the dashboards via the navigation bar in your Vue application.

## Future Plans

- Enhance the dashboard with more visualization options.
- Improve API performance and scalability.
- Add user authentication and authorization.
